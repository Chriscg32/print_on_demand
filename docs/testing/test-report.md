## Areas for Improvement

1. **Error Boundary Testing**: Add tests for React error boundaries to ensure graceful failure handling.

2. **Edge Cases**: Improve coverage of edge cases such as:

   - Very large numbers of designs
   - Network throttling and timeout scenarios
   - Concurrent API requests

3. **Accessibility Testing**: Expand automated accessibility tests to cover more WCAG criteria.

4. **Performance Testing**: Add tests for component rendering performance and API response time thresholds.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the suggested improvements to increase test coverage to 95%+
2. Add visual regression tests using Storybook and Chromatic
3. Implement load testing for API endpoints
4. Add cross-browser testing using BrowserStack or similar service
