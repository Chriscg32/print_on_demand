## DesignSelector Component

### Code Review Findings

#### ✅ Strengths
- [x] Component structure follows React best practices
- [x] Proper use of React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- [x] Error handling for API calls
- [x] Disabled state for publish button when no designs are selected
- [x] Clean separation of concerns between UI and API calls
- [x] PropTypes implemented for type checking

#### ⚠️ Potential Issues

##### Error Handling
- [x] Error messages are displayed to users (not just console logs)
- [x] Loading states shown during API calls
- [ ] Retry mechanism implemented for failed API calls (partially implemented)

##### Performance
- [ ] Pagination implemented for large design lists
- [ ] Memoization used for expensive operations
- [ ] Lazy loading implemented where appropriate

##### UX Considerations
- [x] Design deselection functionality implemented
- [x] Confirmation dialog added before publishing multiple designs
- [x] Success feedback provided after publishing
- [x] "Deselect All" button added

##### Code Structure
- [ ] All functions fully implemented (e.g., startMarketingCampaign)
- [x] PropTypes used for type checking
- [x] Component is properly documented with JSDoc comments

### Pre-Deployment Tasks

#### High Priority (Completed)
- [x] Add user-facing error messages
- [x] Implement loading states for API calls
- [x] Add ability to deselect designs
- [x] Add confirmation dialog before publishing

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement pagination for designs list
- [x] Add success feedback after publishing
- [ ] Complete any partially implemented features
- [x] Add type checking (PropTypes)

#### Low Priority
- [x] Add retry mechanism for failed API calls (basic implementation)
- [ ] Implement memoization for performance optimization
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage

### Deployment Steps
- [ ] Run the test suite to ensure all functionality works as expected
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are correctly configured for the target environment
- [ ] Check for any environment-specific configuration that needs to be updated
- [ ] Ensure proper error tracking is in place
- [ ] Consider a phased rollout to detect any issues early
- [ ] Run the deployment verification script
- [ ] Perform a final manual verification in staging environment

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Monitor error logs for the first 24 hours
- [ ] Verify analytics are capturing user interactions
- [ ] Conduct a post-deployment review meeting
- [ ] Document any issues encountered during deployment
