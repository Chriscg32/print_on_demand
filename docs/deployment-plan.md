# Deployment Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for deploying the Print-on-Demand application to production. The deployment will follow a blue-green deployment strategy to minimize downtime and risk.

|-------|------|------|----------|-------|
| Pre-deployment Testing | 2023-07-15 | 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM | 3 hours | QA Team |
| Staging Deployment | 2023-07-15 | 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM | 1 hour | DevOps |
| Staging Verification | 2023-07-15 | 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM | 2 hours | QA Team |
| Production Deployment | 2023-07-16 | 10:00 PM - 12:00 AM | 2 hours | DevOps |
| Post-deployment Verification | 2023-07-17 | 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM | 2 hours | QA Team |

## Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Accessibility testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] Rollback plan tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-deployment Preparation

1. Freeze code changes 24 hours before deployment
2. Run final test suite on the release branch
3. Create release tag in Git
4. Prepare release notes
5. Notify stakeholders of upcoming deployment

### 2. Staging Deployment

1. Run the deployment script targeting staging:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```
2. Verify application loads correctly in staging
3. Run smoke tests on critical paths:

   - Design browsing
   - Design selection
   - Publishing flow
   - Error handling

4. Verify API integrations are working
5. Check for any console errors or warnings
6. Verify analytics are tracking correctly
7. Get stakeholder sign-off on staging

### 3. Production Deployment

1. Create backup of current production environment
2. Run the deployment script targeting production:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```
3. Monitor deployment logs for any errors
4. Verify CloudFront cache invalidation completes
5. Run health checks on all endpoints
6. Gradually route traffic to the new deployment (blue-green)

### 4. Post-deployment Verification

1. Run smoke tests on production
2. Verify all API integrations are working
3. Check application performance metrics
4. Monitor error rates in logging system
5. Verify user analytics are tracking correctly
6. Check third-party integrations

### 5. Rollback Plan

If critical issues are detected after deployment, follow these steps to rollback:

1. Run the rollback script:
   ```bash
   npm run rollback:prod
   ```
2. Verify the previous version is restored
3. Notify stakeholders of the rollback
4. Document the issues that triggered the rollback

## Monitoring and Alerting

During and after deployment, monitor the following:

1. **Application Health**

   - API response times
   - Error rates
   - CPU and memory usage

2. **User Experience**

   - Page load times
   - Client-side errors
   - Conversion rates

3. **Infrastructure**

   - S3 bucket metrics
   - CloudFront distribution metrics
   - API Gateway metrics

## Communication Plan

| Timing | Audience | Message | Channel | Owner |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 week before | All stakeholders | Deployment schedule and expected impact | Email | Project Manager |
| 1 day before | All stakeholders | Deployment reminder | Email & Slack | Project Manager |
| During deployment | Technical team | Deployment status updates | Slack | DevOps |
| After deployment | All stakeholders | Deployment completion and status | Email | Project Manager |
| If rollback | All stakeholders | Rollback notification and next steps | Email & Slack | Project Manager |

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered successful if:

1. All critical user flows work correctly in production
2. Error rates remain below 0.1%
3. Page load times are under 2 seconds
4. API response times are under 500ms
5. No security vulnerabilities are introduced
6. All accessibility requirements are met

## Post-deployment Tasks

1. Monitor application performance for 48 hours
2. Collect user feedback
3. Document any issues or improvements for future deployments
4. Conduct deployment retrospective meeting
5. Update documentation based on deployment learnings
